Weather

    temperature:
        emperature is a physical quantity expressing hot and cold.
    humidity:
        Humidity is the concentration of water vapour present in air.

    visibility:
        Visibility sensors measure the meteorological optical range which is defined as the length of atmosphere over which a beam of light travels before its luminous flux is reduced to 5% of its original value.

    apparentTemperature:
        Apparent temperature is the temperature equivalent perceived by humans, caused by the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The measure is most commonly applied to the perceived outdoor temperature.
    pressure:
        Falling air pressure indicates that bad weather is coming, while rising air pressure indicates good weather
    windSpeed:
        Wind speed, or wind flow speed, is a fundamental atmospheric quantity caused by air moving from high to low pressure, usually due to changes in temperature.
    cloudCover:
        Cloud cover (also known as cloudiness, cloudage, or cloud amount) refers to the fraction of the sky obscured by clouds when observed from a particular location. Okta is the usual unit of measurement of the cloud cover.
    windBearing:
        In meteorology, an azimuth of 000° is used only when no wind is blowing, while 360° means the wind is from the North. True Wind Direction True North is represented on a globe as the North Pole. All directions relative to True North may be called "true bearings."
    dewPoint:
        the atmospheric temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense and dew can form.
    precipProbability:
        A probability of precipitation (POP), also referred to as chance of precipitation or chance of rain, is a measure of the probability that at least some minimum quantity of precipitation will occur within a specified forecast period and location.
    precipIntensity:
        The intensity of rainfall is a measure of the amount of rain that falls over time. The intensity of rain is measured in the height of the water layer covering the ground in a period of time. It means that if the rain stays where it falls, it would form a layer of a certain height.
